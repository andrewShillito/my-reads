# MyReads 
A single page book tracking react application bootstrapped with Create-React-App.  

## There are three shelves:
* CurrentlyReading
* Want to Read
* Read

and a Search Page where you can add new books or alter the shelf of books already on your shelves.
The search page is keyword driven - the terms can be viewed [here](https://github.com/andrewShillito/my-reads/blob/master/SEARCH_TERMS.md)

## There are two routes:
* /
* /search

## Two commands to run the app:
```
npm install
npm start
```
